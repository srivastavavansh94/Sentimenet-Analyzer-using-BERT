# Sentiment Analyzer with BERT

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model that classifies text reviews as positive or negative using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The model has been trained on a custom dataset and is deployed as a web application using Streamlit on Hugging Face Hub.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies reviews as "Good" or "Bad".
- **BERT Model**: Utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing with BERT.
- **Web Application**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Hugging Face for easy access.
